title: About Me
---

I am a front-end developer with more than 3 years of experience. I'm a quick learner and ready to take new challenges. During my last 2 years at Alipay and Binance, I've learned a lot of industry-leading practices in system design and web performance. I'm now looking for work opportunities in Europe with visa sponsorship.
