Led the frontend team to refactor the code base of the company website.

-   Trained the team to level up their skills on Vue development and functional programming. The legacy code was near unmaintainable, with unstructured procedural code scattered all around. I persuaded the team to use more functional programming techniques to improve code readability and maintainability.

-   Chose Nuxt.js to implement server-side rendering. This had boosted both DX and app performance.

-   Applied various techniques to improve the website performance.

-   Pushed for the adoption of best practices and technologies. e.g. BEM for CSS naming convention and Sass for modern CSS solution.
