At Mengzhiduo, I worked at the front-end team to build hybrid social networking apps. I wrote React Native apps and embedded them into native platforms.

-   Building high fidelity UI components. We used Mobx as the state management solution. I introduced RxJS to simplify some logic.

-   TDD as the first principle. The team placed a high priority on software quality. Guided by this principle, I honed my skills to write programs that are loosely coupled and easy to test.
